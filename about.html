      <h6><strong>Carlos Trancoso</strong> is a Portuguese visual artist that works and lives in Porto.
        He uses the photographic gaze in a critical perspective on the way the human being relates to technology. His work aims to challenge established patterns of interaction and creation of images in contemporary society. Although he mainly uses fictional approaches, his work intermingles with a documental photography language, creating cameraless images, mixed media and computer generated images.
        He is a member of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bardacoletivo/">Barda</a> colective and part of <a href="https://www.futures-photography.com/artists/carlos-trancoso">Futures Photography</a> platform as a selected artist by <a href="https://showcase.ciclo.art/en">Ci.Clo</a> and has recently exhibited at festivals such as <a href="https://photoalicante.com/">Photoalicante</a> in Spain, <a href="https://backlight.fi/">Backlight</a> in Finland, <a href="https://photopenup.com/">Photo Open Up</a> in Italy and <a href="https://bienaldamaia23.pt/">Bienal da Maia</a> and<a href="https://fest-amarante.com/"> f/est Amarante</a> in Portugal.</h6>
